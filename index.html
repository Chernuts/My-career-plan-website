<h2>Income</h2>
<p>Real estate sales agents have a very dependent source of income. An average worker makes a salary of roughly 50,00 per year. This does not apply to all though. These numbers are based off of your efficiency in the field. Along with how many sales you make in that year. Success in the field bring you a long way, but failure is a whole different story. Real estate sales agents also have to be very patient with their clients. While simoutaneously making them feel safe and content. </p>

<h2>Section Three</h2>

<p>Being a real estate sales agent isn't exactly easy either. It's not like being an entrepreneur where you could just walk out the front door and start a multi-million dollar business. Real estate sales agents need time. Every decision counts and failure has hard consequences. To even become a real estate sales agent, you would need to have a high school diploma, efficient conversational skills, patience, and have knowledge in various fields of work. Such as business, arts and humanties, safety and government and communications.</p>
